The Clever Fox and the Cunning Crow
Once upon a time, in a lush green forest in England, there lived a clever fox who was always looking for an easy meal. One fine morning, he spotted a cunning crow sitting on an oak tree, clutching a large piece of cheese in its beak.

The fox, being quite the trickster, thought of a way to get the cheese. He looked up at the crow and said,
"Good day, dear crow! What a magnificent creature you are! Your feathers shine like polished ebony, and your eyes are as bright as the morning sun. Surely, with such beauty, your voice must be just as splendid!"

The crow, flattered by the fox’s words, puffed up with pride. Eager to prove its melodious voice, it opened its beak and let out a loud caw!—but in doing so, the cheese dropped from its beak.

With a swift movement, the fox snatched the cheese and laughed,
"Ah, my dear crow, your voice is indeed as impressive as your looks—but a little wisdom would serve you better!"

The crow, realising its mistake, felt humiliated. But from that day onwards, it became much wiser and never fell for flattery again.

Moral of the Story: Flattery can be deceptive, and wisdom is more valuable than pride!
